User Story

AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am ready to start I will clone the repository with the link provided below

THEN the user will go to the index.js folder and do an NPM INSTALL

WHEN the install is complete the user will enter node index.js into the command-line

THEN the application will load and the following message shows:

"Hello Coders! Let\'s build-a-readme! Skip the boring part and just input your answers to our 
developer-approved questionnaire. Let\'s gooooo!"

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the project title, description and the following:

- [Live Demo](#live-demo)
- [Description](#description)
- [Built With](#built-with)
- [Features](#features)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Collaboration](#collaborating)
- [Contact](#contact)
- [License](#license)

WHEN I enter my project title

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

WHEN I input all the answers to the questionnaire

THEN this information is added to the relevant sections automatically

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options

THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the 
application is covered under

WHEN I enter my GitHub username

THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
